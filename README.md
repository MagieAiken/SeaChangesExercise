# SeaChangesExercise

A repository containing a variety of files uploaded by Magie, Esther and Liz in order to practice
editing and creating files, making folders, creating README docs, and collaborating by using pull requests
and merges.

The two folders are:
1. Scripts - contains any R script added to the repository
2. Participants - contains a file with a list of participants in the workshop
